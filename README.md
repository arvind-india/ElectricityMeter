# Android Electricty Meter reader

This is an import of the code I found [here](http://blog.jfedor.org/2012/02/electricity-meter-fun.html).

The original code had trouble on some devices because the preview resolution
was smaller than many modern phones can manage. This version calls
getSupportedPreviewSizes to find the smallest supported preview size.

Please note that I am in no way a java programmer. I'm a python coder who last
coded java ten years ago.

As far as I can determine, you need Eclipse to build this.
